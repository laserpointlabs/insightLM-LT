# Response: 2D-to-3D Conversion Question

**Great question - not dumb at all!** Here's the distinction:

**The Key Difference:**

I have **foundational software/systems engineering expertise** - that's what transfers across domains. When building missile software, I'm applying my software engineering skills to learn missile-specific requirements. The AI helps me learn the domain faster, but I'm using skills I already have.

For 2D-to-3D conversion, you need **two types of expertise**:
1. **Foundational:** Software engineering (architecture, algorithms, validation)
2. **Domain:** Naval architecture (understanding what 2D elements map to what 3D structures, validating correctness)

**So the answer is: YES, absolutely!** If you have a 2D-to-3D drawing SME who ALSO has foundational software engineering skills, then InsightLM-LT + Cursor could absolutely enable them to build the conversion software. 

**The distinction we made this morning was probably too narrow.** The real answer is:
- If the SME has software engineering skills → Yes, they can build it themselves
- If they don't → They'd need to pair with someone who does (like I'm doing with missile software - I'm the software engineer learning the domain)

**Bottom line:** The tool amplifies whatever foundational expertise you bring. If a 2D-to-3D SME has software engineering chops, they're golden. If not, pair them with someone who does, and together they'll build it fast.

Does that clarify the distinction?
